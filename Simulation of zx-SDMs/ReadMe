For the machine learning part, the first step was to build the simulated datasets as an input to train CNNs. Here, a crystal structure library was built to include various possible configurations, around the FCC and L12 crystal structures. Several parameters were considered to construct the crystal structure library, including lattice parameters, crystallographic rotation, simulating limited spatial resolution, loss of atoms simulating imperfect detection efficiency, and data size (number of atoms). Then, the simulated zx-SDMs along with [011] were generated from these simulated configurations.
